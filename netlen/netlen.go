// Package netlen measures routed nets: how long each one is, how long it takes
// a signal to cross it, and which pads are actually joined by copper.
//
// The work is done on a graph built from the net's own copper. Tracks are
// edges; their endpoints, the points where one track lands partway along
// another, and the pads themselves are nodes. Vias stitch layers together. A
// net's length is then a question about paths in that graph rather than a sum
// over items, which matters because a fly-by net branches: adding up all its
// copper counts the stubs, and KiCad does not.
//
// Reproducing KiCad's own number exactly is a deliberate goal. A tool that
// reports a length the user cannot see in pcbnew's net inspector is a tool the
// user cannot check, so the engine is validated against lengths extracted from
// kicad-cli itself.
