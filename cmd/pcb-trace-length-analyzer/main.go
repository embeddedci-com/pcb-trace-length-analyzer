// Command pcb-trace-length-analyzer reports on and length-matches the DDR routing in a
// KiCad board.
//
// It runs in two halves, on purpose. The first reads the board and prints what
// it found: which nets make up the interface, which of them are actually
// routed, how far each sits from the length it should be, and what it would
// change. Nothing is written. The second applies those changes, and only after
// the first half has been read and confirmed.
//
// The split is not ceremony. The analysis is where the judgement is -- whether
// the nets were grouped correctly, whether the tolerances are the right ones
// for the speed grade, whether an unrouted leg means the board is not ready --
// and none of that can be checked from a diff afterwards.

  pcb-trace-length-analyzer [flags] <board.kicad_pcb>

Reads the board and reports the interfaces on it, how far each net is from the
length it should be, and what to do about it. It writes nothing: -apply is the
experimental half that folds the meanders in, and it asks before it does.

DDR is read in full, down to each memory of the fly-by chain. Every other interface
it recognises -- Ethernet, USB, PCIe, MIPI, SD, and any pair of complements --
is measured and reported.

Examples:
  pcb-trace-length-analyzer board.kicad_pcb
        report only

  pcb-trace-length-analyzer -apply -out tuned.kicad_pcb board.kicad_pcb
        report, ask, then write the result to a new file

  pcb-trace-length-analyzer -apply -only-group "byte lane 3" -yes board.kicad_pcb
        tune one group without asking, writing board.tuned.kicad_pcb

  pcb-trace-length-analyzer -clock-offset 2.5 board.kicad_pcb
        aim the address and command group 2.5% longer than the clock

  pcb-trace-length-analyzer -apply -expand board.kicad_pcb
        where a bus is too tight to meander, spread it sideways into clear
        space first. This moves every trace in that bus, not only the ones
        selected; each keeps its own endpoints and the traces keep their order.

  pcb-trace-length-analyzer -apply -route board.kicad_pcb
        create the copper for the fly-by hops the board is missing. This is the
        only thing here that adds a connection rather than lengthening one, so
        it is opt-in and it says exactly what it laid. Until the chain exists
        there is no topology to match.

  pcb-trace-length-analyzer -apply -area 60,60,95,95 board.kicad_pcb
        only add copper inside that region. Room beside a trace is not the same
        as somewhere you want copper -- it can be in a BGA fanout, under a
        connector, or across a split in a plane, and a clearance check cannot
        tell the difference. Repeat -area for several. The web front end lets
        you draw them on the board instead.

  pcb-trace-length-analyzer -open-clearance 0.25 board.kicad_pcb
        keep 0.25 mm between nets away from the components, whatever the board
        says. A fine-pitch BGA forces a tight clearance onto the whole board
        because that is what makes the escape possible; in the open there is
        usually more room, and using it means less coupling and more space to
        meander into. Around the components the board's own rules still stand,
        and a differential pair is exempt in both directions. Pass 0 to hold
        to the board's rules everywhere.

After applying, verify with KiCad's own design rule check:
  kicad-cli pcb drc --format json --output drc.json tuned.kicad_pcb
