// The published length rules of the parts people actually build with.
//
// Every number here is copied from the vendor's own layout table, with the
// document, its version and the table it came from beside it, because that is
// what a reviewer will check the board against. Nothing is averaged, rounded
// to something tidier, or carried over from another part: where a guide does
// not state a limit, the preset leaves it unset and the tool's own default
// applies.
//
// A guide states its limits either as a length or as a delay, and this keeps
// whichever it used. Rockchip's 8-layer tables are in picoseconds on purpose --
// on a board where a signal runs partly on an outer layer and partly on an
// inner one, equal length is not equal time -- so converting them to
// millimetres here would throw away the thing the table is careful about.
//
// A limit a guide does not state is left at zero rather than filled in from
// somewhere else. Microchip removed the strobe against clock bound from the
// SAMA5D2 note in its 2018 revision and TI never gave one for the AM64x, and
// borrowing a figure from a sibling part would put a number in front of a
// reviewer that no document backs. The tool's own default applies instead, and
// the preset says so.
